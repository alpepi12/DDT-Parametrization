# Automated Parameterization of 3D CAD Assembly
<sup>*Undergraduate capstone project (2021).*</sup>

## Project Objectives
In this project, our group was tasked to design an underwater waste barrel recovery solution. The final Solidworks CAD assembly is parameterizable based on user inputs, which is the purpose of this MATLAB program.

## Program Functionality
The program uses a GUI to prompt the user for the following design inputs:
- operating depth,
- excavation volume,
- excavation time.

Using mechanical engineering theory and pre-defined safety factors, the program computes all critial parts dimensions. The dimensions are output to text files, which is read by Solidworks to resize the entire CAD model.
